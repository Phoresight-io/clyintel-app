## Known Constraints

- Stripe account is in **live mode**. Do not run test transactions against the live account without explicit approval.
- MailerSend is the email provider. Do not add SendGrid, Resend, or other email providers without approval.
- Softr handles the subscriber portal. Do not duplicate this in the Next.js app without approval.
- Airtable is **retired as operational DB**. Table/field IDs in `PRODUCT_CONTEXT.md` are migration reference only — do not write new Airtable integration code.

## Agent Rules (product-level)

1. Read `.ai/clyintel/PRODUCT_CONTEXT.md` for full tier definitions, business rules, and Stripe IDs.
2. Do not add new npm packages without confirming with the user.
3. Keep AI-generated code clearly separated from manually written code where possible.
4. Do not write Airtable integration code. Supabase is the operational database.
